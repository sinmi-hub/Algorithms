# Algorithms

================================================================

Implementation of various algorithms

I intend to use this repository as a learning process to solve various problems, using different languages, so I can understand how they work.

I am building my Operating System called **Wale**, and I believe relative proficieny in these languages will be quite useful.

Problems solved here are sourced from exercism, hyperskill and other various internet sources.

Some of the languages used:
- C
- Bash scripting
- x86 assembly
- Python
 
==================================================================

- [ ] Ongoing Tasks
    - [x] rename all sub readme's with small letter
    - [x] complete documentation
    - [ ] create makefile, ensure to include -lm

- [ ] Math directory
  - [x] alegbra
  - [x] cryptography
  - [x] math-basics
  - [x] number_theory

- [ ] Search Algorithms
    - [x] Binary Search
    - [ ] MergeSort
    - [ ] QuickSort

========================================================================

## Notes

- For *Shell scripts* that uses Bash as interpreters, simply downdload script and give executable permission
  ```bash
  chmod +x [filename]
  ```

- For *C* programs that contain header files, and source files, **gcc** or any other any other compatible complier should be good to create an executable.

- Other flags may be required depending on project
  ```c
  gcc -o [filename] [filename.c] 
  ```
