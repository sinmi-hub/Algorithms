# Algorithms

================================================================

Implementation of various algorithm

I intend to use this repository as a learning process to solve various problems, using different languages, so I can understand how they work.

I am building my Operating System called **Wale**, and I believe relative proficieny in these languages will be quite useful.

Problems solved here are sourced from exercism, hyperskill and other various internet sources.

Some of the languages used:
- C
- Bash scripting
- x86 assembly
- Python
