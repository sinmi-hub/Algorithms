These are basic function in mathematics that are implemented in C code. 

#### unsigned int *find_multiples(unsigned int num, int n)
-  Finds and returns all the multiples of a given number within a given range.
-  The return value of this function should be *FREED*.

-        @param num: given number
-        @param n: upper limit of range, when finding multiples of *num*
-        @return array containing multiples of *num*, up to n.

#### unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int number)
 
 * Calculates the sum of squares of a given number.
 
 *      @param number The number for which the sum of squares is to be calculated.
 *      @return The sum of squares of the given number.

#### unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int number)
 * Calculates the square of the sum of numbers up to a given number.
 
 *      @param number The number up to which the sum is calculated.
 *      @return The square of the sum of numbers up to the given number.

#### unsigned int gcd(int num1, int num2)
 * Calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
 
 *      @param num1 (first number).
 *      @param num2 (second number).
 *      @return The GCD of the two numbers.

#### unsigned int lcm(int num1, int num2)
 * Calculates the least common multiples(LCM) of two numbers.
 * `num1 must be bigger than num2 during function call`
 
 *      @param num1 (first number).
 *      @param num2 (second number).
 *      @return lcm of the two numbers.
