These are basic function in mathematics that are implemented in C code. 

#### unsigned int *find_multiples(unsigned int num, int n)
-  Finds and returns all the multiples of a given number within a given range.
-  The return value of this function should be FREED.

-        @param num: The number to find multiples of.
-        @param n: The nth multiple of parameter num
-        @return The nth multiple of num.

#### unsigned int sum_of_squares(unsigned int number)
 
 * Calculates the sum of squares of a given number.
 
 *      @param number The number for which the sum of squares is to be calculated.
 *      @return The sum of squares of the given number.

#### unsigned int square_of_sum(unsigned int number)
 * Calculates the square of the sum of numbers up to a given number.
 
 *      @param number The number up to which the sum is calculated.
 *      @return The square of the sum of numbers up to the given number.
